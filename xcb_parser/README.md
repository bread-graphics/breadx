# `xcb-parser`

`xcb-parser` is a simple parser for the [XML-XCB](https://xcb.freedesktop.org/XmlXcb/) format. It is
capable of taking in XML input from XML-XCB descriptions and outputting the constructs described in
them. It is a wrapper on top of the [`quick-xml`](https://crates.io/crates/quick-xml) crate.
