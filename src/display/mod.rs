//! This module provides the bulk of the utilities used to communicate with the X11 server.
//!
//! Although one can just connect to the X server using your average `TcpStream` or `UnixStream` and communicate
//! that way, it tends to be very inconvenient to deal in terms of bytes and not the actual types. This module
//! aims to provide types to simplify dealings with the X server.
//!
//! Note that this module is unpacked into the crate root, so that any item in this module can also be used from
//! the crate directly.
//!
//! # `DisplayBase`, `Display` and `AsyncDisplay`
//!
//! * The [`DisplayBase`] trait is implemented for objects that communicate with the X server. It provides non-IO
//!   functionality like keeping track of pending items and setup information.
//! * The [`Display`] trait is implemented for objects that communicate with the X server in a blocking manner.
//!   It provides functions like `wait_for_event` and `send_request`, although you're more likely to use
//!   functions on its extension traits.
//! * The [`AsyncDisplay`] trait is implemented for objects that communication with the X server in a
//!   non-blocking manner. It is similar to the `Display` trait and tries to mirror its functionality.
//!
//! # `Display` Implementors
//!
//! By default, this module provides the [`BasicDisplay`] and [`CellDisplay`] types, which allow for mutable
//! and immutable access, respectively. Both implement `DisplayBase`, `Display`, and `AsyncDisplay`. If you
//! enable the `sync-display` feature, you will also gain access to the [`SyncDisplay`] type, which allows for
//! immutable and thread-safe usage.
//!
//! # `Connection`, `AsyncConnection`, and `NameConnection`
//!
//! The [`Connection`] and [`AsyncConnection`] traits are implemented for the raw connection types that the
//! `Display` implementors wrap themselves around, like `TcpStream` and `UnixStream`. However, you are most
//! likely to use the [`NameConnection`](name::NameConnection), since it represents a connection to the X server
//! resolved from the server's name.

/// implementing this trait in some way, shape, or form.

/// Internally, this should act as a layer of abstraction over the inner `Connection` object that keeps track

/// X11 usually takes place over a TCP stream or a Unix socket connection.
